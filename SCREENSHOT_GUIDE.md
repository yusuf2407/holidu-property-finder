# Screenshot Preparation for Chrome Web Store

## Chrome Web Store Requirements

Screenshots must be:
- **Resolution:** 1280x800 or 640x400 pixels (aspect ratio 16:10)
- **Format:** PNG or JPEG
- **Minimum:** 1 screenshot (maximum 5)

---

## Quick Method: Manual Resize

Since you already have a screenshot, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Save Your Screenshot

1. Save the screenshot image you shared as: `screenshot-raw.png`
2. Place it in this directory: `/Users/yusufmonaf/Documents/holidu-property-finder/`

### Step 2: Run the Conversion Script

Open Terminal in this directory and run:

```bash
./prepare-screenshot.sh
```

This will automatically create:
- `screenshot-1280x800.png` (recommended)
- `screenshot-640x400.png` (alternative)

---

## Alternative: Direct Command

If you prefer to do it manually with a single command:

### For 1280x800 (Recommended):
```bash
sips -z 800 1280 screenshot-raw.png --out screenshot-1280x800.png
```

### For 640x400:
```bash
sips -z 400 640 screenshot-raw.png --out screenshot-640x400.png
```
