**1st Rejection:** October 24, 2025 - Unused `scripting` permission (Violation ID: Purple Potassium)  
**2nd Rejection:** October 27, 2025 - Unused `activeTab` permission (Violation ID: Purple Potassium)  
**Root Cause:** Used wrong permission - need `tabs` not `activeTab` to read tab.url

**Current Version:** 2.1.0  
**Status:** Ready to resubmit with correct permission

## üîß What Was Fixed

### Issue Timeline:
1. **1st Rejection:** Unused `scripting` permission - we removed it
2. **2nd Rejection:** Unused `activeTab` permission - wrong permission!
3. **Root Cause:** Extension reads `tabs[0].url` which requires `tabs` permission, not `activeTab`

### Technical Explanation:
- `activeTab` = Temporary access to inject scripts when user clicks icon
- `tabs` = Read tab metadata like URL, title, etc.
- Our code in `prepare.js` line 281: `new URL(tabs[0].url).hostname` requires **`tabs`** permission

### Fix Applied:
1. ‚úÖ Removed `scripting` permission (1st fix)
2. ‚úÖ Changed `activeTab` to `tabs` permission (2nd fix)
3. ‚úÖ Updated `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` to reflect tabs permission
4. ‚úÖ Recreated package with `prepare.js` included
5. ‚úÖ Updated permission justifications below

### Current Permissions (2 only):
- ‚úÖ `storage` - Save preferences and property data locally
- ‚úÖ `tabs` - Read current tab URL and open new tabs

**Single Purpose Description:**
```
This extension helps Holidu team members quickly search and navigate to specific properties on Holidu websites using advanced filters (payment types, services, discounts, meal options, etc.) for QA testing, customer support, and development purposes.
```

**Permission Justifications:**

**Storage Justification:**
```
The storage permission is used to save user preferences, discovered property data, and Elasticsearch query logs locally in the browser. This allows the extension to maintain a database of properties, remember filter settings, and provide query history for debugging without requiring external servers.
```

**Tabs Justification:**
```
The tabs permission is required to detect the current Holidu domain by reading the active tab's URL (line 281 in prepare.js: new URL(tabs[0].url).hostname) and to open property pages in new tabs (line 271: chrome.tabs.create). This ensures the extension opens properties on the correct Holidu website (holidu.com, holidu.de, etc.) based on the user's current browsing context.
```

**Host Permission Justification:**
```
Host permissions are required to access Holidu's internal APIs (api.holidu.com), Elasticsearch service (kibana-search-7.holidu.cloud), and all Holidu brand domains (holidu.com, holidu.de, holidu.fr, etc.) to fetch property data, validate availability, and navigate users to the correct property pages across different Holidu websites.
```

**Remote Code Usage:**
- Selected: **No, I am not using remote code** ‚úÖ
- Note: Fetching JSON data from APIs is NOT considered remote code. Only executable JavaScript/WebAssembly loaded externally counts as remote code.

**Data Usage:**
- No user data collection boxes checked ‚ùå
- All three disclosure certifications checked ‚úÖ:
  - ‚úÖ I do not sell or transfer user data to third parties
  - ‚úÖ I do not use or transfer user data for unrelated purposes
  - ‚úÖ I do not use or transfer user data for creditworthiness/lending

**Privacy Policy URL:**
